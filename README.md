##  Standards I had some role in influencing

While working on the DARPA XG Program, I wrote significant portions of the spectrum policy language sections of this [2005 report](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA437096.pdf). You can compare this report with the IEEE P1900.5.1 standard and draw your own 
conclusions about the uncredited history of this work prior to IEEE DySPAN-SC. Unfortunately some hard lessons I had learned in XG 
do not seem to have made it to the standard. In my retrospective opinion, a better design would accord a constraints DSL (e.g., MiniZinc) more 
prominence within the language, while judiciously including modal logics (obligations, prohibitions, preferences) and description 
logics to the extent necessary. We had it backwards in the XG policy language, and overly focused on DL/ontologies.

While working on the DARPA DTN program, I had participated in and contributed to the IRTF DTN WG in small ways.
