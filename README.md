## Standards My Work Influenced

While working on the DARPA XG Program, I wrote the original text for significant portions of the spectrum policy language sections of this [2005 report](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA437096.pdf). While the IEEE P1900.5.1 standard does not credit this report, it is more unfortunate that the hard lessons I learned from the earlier work did not make it into the standard. In my retrospective opinion, a better design would accord a constraints DSL more prominence within the language, while judiciously including modal logics (obligations, prohibitions, preferences) and description logics minimally as needed.

While working on the DARPA DTN program, I had [participated](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dtn-interest/KQFRTBWkMga5pRTXuP3tbDzu-n8/) in the IRTF DTNRG.
