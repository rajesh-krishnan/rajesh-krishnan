##  Standards I Influenced in Minor Ways 

While working on the DARPA XG Program, I wrote the original text for significant portions of the spectrum policy language sections of this [2005 report](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA437096.pdf). While the IEEE P1900.5.1 standard does not credit this report, it is not hard to see its influence. It is more unfortunate that the hard lessons I learned in XG did not make it into the standard. In my retrospective opinion, a better design would accord a constraints DSL (e.g., MiniZinc) more prominence within the language, while judiciously including modal logics (obligations, prohibitions, preferences) and description logics as needed. We had it backwards in the XG policy language, and overly focused on DL/ontologies.

While working on the DARPA DTN program, I had [participated](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dtn-interest/KQFRTBWkMga5pRTXuP3tbDzu-n8/) in the IRTF DTNRG in small ways.
