## About Myself

My name is Rajesh Krishnan. I am a naturalized US citizen of Bharatiya (Indian) origin, and I currently live in Fort Valley, Virginia, USA. 

I am a retired computer scientist by profession, and I am a senior member of the Association for Computing Machinery.  You can find a list of my patents, publications, and technical reports on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=aMfW5dMAAAAJ&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate). You can find my open-source software contributions on [GitHub] (https://github.com/rajesh-krishnan).

My other interests include minimalism, veganism, and sanatana dharma (especially yoga and vedanta).

## Influence on Standards

While working on the DARPA XG Program, I wrote the original text for the spectrum policy language portions of this [report](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA437096.pdf), which has a clear, albeit uncredited, influence on the IEEE P1900.5.1 standard. In my retrospective opinion, a better design would accord a constraints DSL more prominence within the language, while including modal and description logics more judiciously. I briefly followed the IEEE P1900.5 WG in 2024, but lost interest..

While working on the DARPA DTN program, I had [participated](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dtn-interest/KQFRTBWkMga5pRTXuP3tbDzu-n8/) in the IRTF DTNRG.
