## Influence on Standards

While working on the DARPA XG Program, I wrote the original text for the spectrum policy language portions of this [report](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA437096.pdf), which has a clear, albeit uncredited, influence on the IEEE P1900.5.1 standard. In my retrospective opinion, a better design would accord a constraints DSL more prominence within the language, while including modal and description logics more judiciously. I briefly followed the IEEE P1900.5 WG in 2024, but lost interest..

While working on the DARPA DTN program, I had [participated](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/dtn-interest/KQFRTBWkMga5pRTXuP3tbDzu-n8/) in the IRTF DTNRG.
